Week 6:- NodeJS and ExpressJS
Create an API using Express.js for managing food and nutrition data. Implement endpoints to save data in a database using Postman and retrieve data using Express.
Instructions:

Set up your development environment:
Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your machine if you havenâ€™t already.
Initialize a new Node.js project using npm init.
Install necessary dependencies including Express.js, Mongoose (for MongoDB integration), and any other required packages.
Define the schema for your food and nutrition data:
Decide on the structure of your data model, including all the columns mentioned earlier (Food Item Name, Food Group, Description, Nutritional Information, Serving Size, Allergens, Ingredients, Preparation Methods, Certifications, Country of Origin, Brand or Manufacturer, Dietary Restrictions, Health Benefits, Best Practices).
Use Mongoose to create a schema that represents the structure of your data model.
Implement CRUD operations using Express.js:
Create routes and controllers for handling CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for your food and nutrition data.
Define endpoints for saving new food items, retrieving all food items, retrieving a specific food item by ID, updating a food item, and deleting a food item.
Set up MongoDB database:
Configure connection to your MongoDB database using Mongoose.
Ensure that your MongoDB database is running and accessible from your Express.js application.
Test your API endpoints using Postman:
Use Postman to send HTTP requests to your API endpoints.
Test saving new food items by sending POST requests with the necessary data in the request body.
Test retrieving all food items, retrieving a specific food item by ID, updating a food item, and deleting a food item using appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Handle validation and error handling:
Implement validation checks to ensure that the data being saved is valid and meets any specified criteria.
Implement error handling to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to the client.
For a Food and Nutrition database or API, you can consider adding the following rows and columns to capture comprehensive information about food items, nutritional values, and related attributes:
 Food Item Name: This column captures the name or title of the food item.
Food Group or Category: Categorize food items into groups such as fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy, proteins, fats, etc.
Description: A brief description or summary of the food item, including any notable features or characteristics.
Nutritional Information: Include columns for various nutritional components, such as:
Calories: Total energy content provided by the food item.
Macronutrients: Proteins, fats, carbohydrates, including detailed breakdowns of saturated, unsaturated, and trans fats, as well as sugar content.
Micronutrients: Vitamins (A, C, D, etc.), minerals (iron, calcium, potassium, etc.), and other essential nutrients.
Fiber: Dietary fiber content.
Sodium: Sodium content, important for individuals monitoring their salt intake.
Cholesterol: Cholesterol content, particularly relevant for individuals with heart health concerns.
Serving Size: Specify the serving size for which the nutritional information is provided (e.g., per 100g, per serving, etc.).
Allergens: List any common allergens present in the food item, such as gluten, nuts, soy, dairy, etc.
Ingredients: Include a column to list the ingredients used to prepare the food item.
Preparation Methods: Describe how the food item is typically prepared or cooked.
Certifications: Indicate any certifications or labels associated with the food item, such as organic, non-GMO, fair trade, etc.
Country of Origin: Specify the country or region where the food item is sourced or produced.
Brand or Manufacturer: If applicable, include information about the brand or manufacturer of the food item.
Dietary Restrictions: Flag dietary restrictions such as vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc., to help individuals with specific dietary needs.
Health Benefits: Describe any potential health benefits or nutritional advantages associated with consuming the food item.
Best Practices: Provide guidance on safe handling, storage, and consumption of the food item.
These columns aim to provide comprehensive information about food items, enabling users to make informed decisions about their dietary choices and nutritional intake. Depending on the specific requirements and scope of your Food and Nutrition database or API, you may customize the columns and add additional attributes as needed.
